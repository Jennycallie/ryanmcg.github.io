Like most software these days this website was built using other tools.

My thanks to the authors of the following projects for allowing me (and others)
to stand on their shoulders.

### Icons

This website uses the fantastic [Font Awesome][] by Dave Gandy. It is a [fully open
source][fa-license] icon font.

### Typeface

The typeface used on this website is [Roboto] by Christian Robertson.

> Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
> largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
> curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,
> Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural
> width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in
> humanist and serif types.
