# Static website generation with [incise][]

A few months of work and one spin off library later I am now releasing a `0.1.0` version of incise
([see it on clojars](https://clojars.org/incise)).
I offer very little justification for offering the world yet another option for static website generation.
I simply felt that what was available was not ideal for me.
I also wanted my generator to be implement in [Clojure][], my preferred language.

Your best introduction to incise is available on [its website][incise] which is generated from its [README][] by, you guessed it, incise.
Here are some highlights:

* Use Clojure ✓
* Allow many different setups and configurations ✓
* Extensible by nature ✓
* Batteries included ✓
